Full-Scale Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using Data Science
This project utilizes Python to develop a comprehensive stock market analysis and prediction system. It leverages financial data from the yfinance library to perform detailed technical analysis, including the calculation of moving averages and correlation matrices. The project incorporates Monte Carlo simulations for risk analysis and utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future stock prices. Additionally, portfolio optimization techniques, such as the Sharpe ratio, are used to identify stable stocks. This project showcases the integration of data science, machine learning, and financial analysis to make data-driven predictions and decisions in the stock market.
